# camelcase-keys (forked)

> Convert object keys to camelCase using [`camelcase`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase)

## About this fork
This fork diverges from the author's repo,
and only included a very useful feature provided
in the original package added in v4.0.0.

There were another breaking change in v4.0.0
which is upgrading to es6:
When used by our react app, we don't transpile
es6 in the node_modules dir.
When the es6 syntax is read by Uglify,
things break.

Therefore, our solution is to maintain our own fork
without the breaking change.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save https://github.com/leoi11/camelcase-keys

const camelcaseKeys = require('camelcase-keys');

//=> {fooBar: true, nested: {unicornRainbow: true}}
```

```js
const camelcaseKeys = require('camelcase-keys');

const argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
